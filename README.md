ðŸ“˜ Project Description: RescueMate â€“ AI-Driven Emergency Response System
RescueMate is a comprehensive AI-powered emergency notification and coordination system designed to streamline how individuals report emergencies and how response teams act on them. Built entirely using the Microsoft Power Platform â€” including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents) â€” RescueMate delivers real-time support, intelligent triaging, and efficient resource coordination in high-stress scenarios.

ðŸ§© Key Features
Multi-Channel Emergency Reporting
Users can report emergencies through an intuitive mobile or desktop interface using structured forms or an embedded AI-powered chatbot.

AI-Powered Severity Detection
The system intelligently classifies reported incidents into low, medium, or high severity using branching logic and built-in escalation rules in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

Automated Workflows and Escalation
Leveraging Power Automate, reports trigger pre-defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), alert relevant personnel, and route critical incidents to appropriate responders or departments.

Real-Time User Feedback and Support
Users receive live status updates on their report, are guided with relevant safety instructions, and are reassured through comfort messaging designed for crisis situations.

Live Analytics and Response Dashboard
Using Power BI, a real-time dashboard aggregates incident data, response times, and severity levels, allowing authorities or managers to make informed decisions on resource allocation and intervention strategies.

Fast Prototyping and Scalable Design
The Power Platform stack was chosen for its low-code capabilities, fast development cycle, and seamless integration, making RescueMate adaptable to various emergency response use cases â€” from workplaces and campuses to public safety agencies.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
Power Apps (Canvas App): For user interfaces including incident reporting forms, report status tracking, and dashboard integration.

Power Automate: For backend automation including routing, escalation logic, and SOP execution.

Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents): For intelligent chatbot interactions, dynamic conversations, and report intake.

Power BI: For real-time visualization and monitoring of emergency data and trends.

Figma: For wireframing and UI/UX planning (mobile and desktop views).

ðŸš€ How It Works (Workflow Overview)
User Reports an Emergency via form or chatbot in the app.

Chatbot or Form Input is Analyzed to determine severity (high, medium, low).

Automated Flows are triggered based on severity, including notifications, SOP logic, and escalations.

User Receives Real-Time Status Updates and guidance on what to do next.

Data is Logged and Visualized through the Power BI dashboard for responder teams or decision-makers.

âœ… Use Cases
Campus or workplace emergency management

Public health or medical incident response

Natural disaster coordination

Real-time employee or citizen safety systems

ðŸ“¦ Deployment & Scalability
RescueMateâ€™s architecture is fully modular and cloud-based, allowing it to scale across organizations and adapt to specialized use cases. It can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or external systems via connectors.
